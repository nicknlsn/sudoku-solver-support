Support page for Sudoku Solver OCR iOS app

Solve sudoku puzzles by entering the puzzle on the board in the app and then tapping the solve button. You can enter puzzles manually by tapping individual cells on the board, or by scanning an image of a puzzle.  The OCR (optical character recognition, the tool that scans the image) in this app is still under development, and screenshots or downloaded images of puzzles work best. Photos of puzzles taken with your camera may not enter all the numbers correctly, but you can still use those images and fix any errors manually by tapping on individual cells on the board.
